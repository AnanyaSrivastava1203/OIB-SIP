Oasis Infobyte Internship Projects
Oasis Infobyte has provided me the opportunity to work on my Web Development and Designing skills, by allotting me three projects:

1)Landing Page
 A landing page is one of the best web development projects for beginners. This project demands a foundational understanding of HTML and CSS. I have learnt how to add columns, divide sections, arrange items, add headers, footers. Most importantly, I’d used my creativity to make the page look impressive. The alignments, the padding, the color palette, boxes and all the other elements on the page. I’ve used CSS carefully to make sure the elements on the page do not overlap.
 
2)Portfolio
A personal portfolio with the basic skills in CSS and HTML. It has an image at the top where I have introduced myself ,below that I’ve added my contact information that includes my email, LinkedIn Profile and GitHub profile link.

3)Temperature converter website
